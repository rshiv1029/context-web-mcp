Your Local AI ←→ MCP Server ←→ Your Data Sources
    (Client)      (Protocol)     (Tools/Resources)


General MCP Creation Process:
1. Define Resources & Tools

Resources: Data your MCP can provide (files, databases, APIs)
Tools: Actions your MCP can perform (search, index, analyze)

2. Implement MCP Server

Handle MCP protocol messages (JSON-RPC)
Expose your resources and tools
Process requests from AI clients

3. Create Client Integration

Connect your local AI to the MCP server
Send context requests before AI queries
Combine MCP context with user questions

For our Context Web MCP specifically:
Resources we'll expose:

file_content - Get content of specific files
relationships - Get related files/concepts
context_summary - Get relevant context for a query

Tools we'll provide:

search_files - Find files matching criteria
find_related - Discover connected information
index_directory - Add new data sources

The MCP Protocol handles:

Authentication and handshake
Resource discovery ("what can you provide?")
Tool execution ("run this search")
Error handling and responses
